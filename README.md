# My first game!

As a game development student, this was my first project.

I've made this game in a month or so, working on it after work hours, and it covers up some basic skills for game development.

### Animations:
- Scene animation (fade in and out)
- Powerup animation (floating and scaling)
- Volume animation (fade in and out)

### Scripting:
- Camera follow in LateUpdate
- State flow (Menu, Play, GameOver)
- Coroutines (player tumbling movement, waitForSeconds)
- Using Input system (horizontal, vertical)
- Keeping highscore in PlayerPrefs
- Powerups (randomly spawned and powerup effect)
- UnityEvents (onGameOver, onPowerupPickup)

### GUI:
- Canvas with buttons and text

### Audio:
- Sounds (powerup appearance, pickup and duration)
- Music
